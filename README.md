# Modular Addition

Final Project for Mathematical Introduction to Machine Learning.

Gives a simple implementation of Transformer model, as a recurrence to Grokking phenomenon according to
paper [Grokking: Generalization Beyond Overfitting on Small Algorithmic Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02177).

## Hardware Requirements

You need GPU which supports TF32 floating point format to reproduce some results.
